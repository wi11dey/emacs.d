An Emacs configuration that aims to have
- support for all editing use-cases
- a minimal UI
- speed in mind, both in terms of responsiveness and user productivity

A custom keyboard layout is used, based off of [[https://github.com/xahlee/xah-fly-keys][xah-fly-keys]] mode for QWERTY with my personl changes that prioritize symbols over numbers:

It takes some getting used to, but typing TeX or general code afterwards is much faster without Shift and with the most-used symbols at your fingertips.

However, if youâ€™d like to stick to plain old QWERTY, or any other keyboard layout supported by [[https://github.com/xahlee/xah-fly-keys][xah-fly-keys]], you can create the following ~site-start.el~ file (which will not be tracked by git):
#+begin_src elisp
(setq xah-fly-key-current-layout qwerty)
#+end_src

Package management is handled by [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]], and ~init.el~ is organized using [[https://github.com/wi11dey/p-ckage][p@ckage]]. It is heavily optimized for precompilation, which should be done if possible after first startup. (On good days, the whole config starts in 0.7s, and in 2s on bad days.)

Enjoy!
